Twitch is fun site for streamers and something millions of people enjoy using to peer into peoples live's. Streamers especially twitch streamers are starting to hit peak popularity, from scandels to award shows its hard to deny the appeal. Just like music, the amount of streamers and streams is immeasurable, reaching a new stream is hard without a good reference or scandal to bring you into it. That's what PTwitch is hoping to close the gap in..

## Starting
Taking the chance to round out my experience with a PERN stack, I will be tackling this project with first structuring both front end and back ends of this project just to get a solid understanding of how I want this to plan out. Once structure the data will be migrated and the front end will commence with focusing heavily on CRUD and JWT. 

### Technologies                          
* React                                
* Sequelize                                              
* Postgres
* CSS/ HTML
* Heroku 
* JavaScript
* Express
* JWT AUTH

## Post MVP
***
In hopes of meeting MVP as quickly as possible I will be hoping to spend the rest of my time integreting Twitch's API to bring in all their streamers, their schedules and much more information to turn this project up to the next level.
